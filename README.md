# lavanderia
Hello everyone! Glad to see you here.

This is my first web application I have made. It's very simples, and intuitive.
This project was supposed to be my final project when I was doing CS50, where I
learned how to program using Flask, a powerful Python framework!

## What does it do?
In summary, it is a self-service laundry web application, which has a data base
with users, locations, machines, products, etc. We can register our selves in it,
and play a little with it, we can buy services, using a ficticious payment method
like a credit card for example, or use our wallet, which has 2000 reais (R$BRL) by default.

## Technologies
- Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Organization Level: Simplest

## News!
Hey! Did you know I'm refactoring this old project?
I was learning a well knwown pattern called Clean Architecture, so I decided to create a remake of this project, following some of the best code practices in terms of code organization.
